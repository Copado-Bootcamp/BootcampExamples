# SAMPLE APEX CLASSES WITH PMD VIOLATIONS FOR HANDS-ON TRAINING

This folder includes 1 Apex Class and the 5 Apex test Classes that, as a collection, are intended to provide coverage for the 1 Apex Class

However, the 6 Apex Classes in this folder were intentionally generated with several common PMD Static Code Analysis Violations, for the purpose of Hands-on Training.

Files are stored in this Repository as lines of code only - these files are not stored here in Salesforce Metadata Format nor Salesforce Source Format Git structure.

The intended use is for a participant in instructor-led or self-paced Hands-on Training to simply copy/paste the lines of code directly into the Salesforce UI as net-new Apex Classes in an Org.

**Assumption** the following Case Queues already exist in all Salesforce Orgs:
1. Partner Escalation Queue
2. Copado Support Queue
